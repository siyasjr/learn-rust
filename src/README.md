# Learning Rust

This repo contains my notes, code snippets, and small projects as I learn the Rust programming language.

## Structure

- `notes/` – Key concepts, syntax summaries, and references
- `examples/` – Small standalone Rust programs for practice
- `projects/` – Mini projects to apply what I've learned
- `exercises/` – Practice problems and solutions

## Goals

- Understand Rust syntax and ownership model
- Practice writing safe and efficient code
- Build small CLI tools and projects
- Write smart contracts / programs (Solana)

## Tools

- Rustup for managing toolchains
- `cargo` for building and running projects
- `rust-analyzer` for better IDE support

## How to Run

```bash
cd examples/hello_world
cargo run
```
